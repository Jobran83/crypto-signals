This is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to help you track trading signals for the most popular cryptocurrencies on the Binance platform.

Key Features:
Live Data: The app fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices from an external API.

Simulated Signals: "Buy," "Sell," and "Hold" signals are calculated based on a simple, clear logic.

Detailed Information: The dashboard displays the buy price, sell price, and stop-loss price for each coin.

Profit Tracking: You can see the potential profit or loss in real-time.

Task Management: A checklist next to each coin helps you keep track of which signals you have already acted on.

Responsive Design: The app is easily accessible and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is just a starting point. You can use it as a foundation to develop a more advanced and intelligent trading dashboard.
